## üí° Agent Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Smart Defaults**
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Let the unified system handle filtering
get_customer_orders()  # Gets relevant recent data

# ‚ùå Avoid: Over-specifying initially
get_customer_orders(since_date="2020-01-01", filter_quality=False)  # Too broad
```

### 2. **Use Cross-System Intelligence**
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Leverage automatic linking
get_sales_dashboard_with_production()  # Shows both sides automatically

# ‚ùå Avoid: Manual linking
get_sales_dashboard() + get_production_dashboard()  # Disconnected data
```

### 3. **Follow Agent Override Guidance**
```python
# When response says "FOR MORE DATA: Use get_customer_orders(since_days=30)"
# Agent should use the suggested override for follow-up queries
```

### 4. **Chain Commands Logically**
```python
# ‚úÖ Good workflow:
# 1. search_orders_with_wildcards("ORDER123%")  # Find related orders
# 2. get_specific_sales_order_with_production("ORDER123")  # Deep dive
# 3. get_customer_order_details("ORDER123")  # Full details if needed
```

## ‚ö° Performance Guidelines

### Command Response Times
| Command Type | Expected Speed | Records Returned |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Dashboards** | < 3 seconds | 25 per section |
| **Main Tools** | < 2 seconds | Up to 200 (auto-paginated) |
| **Bulk Operations** | 5-10 seconds | 200+ records |
| **Cross-System** | 3-5 seconds | Depends on matches |

### When to Use Bulk vs Standard
- **Standard tools** (get_customer_orders, get_production_orders): Up to 200 records
- **Bulk tools** (get_customer_orders_bulk): 200+ records for analysis
- **Dashboard tools**: Fixed 25 records per section for consistency

---

## üîÑ Common Agent Workflows

### 1. **Daily Status Check**
```python
# User: "How's everything looking today?"
get_production_dashboard()           # Production overview
get_sales_dashboard_with_production() # Sales + manufacturing view
```

### 2. **Order Investigation**
```python
# User: "Tell me about order 400139"
get_specific_sales_order_with_production("400139")  # Complete analysis
get_customer_order_details("400139")                # Full sales details
```

### 3. **Status Analysis**
```python
# User: "Show me all RELEASED orders and their production status"
get_sales_orders_with_production_by_status("RELEASED", since_days=30)
```

### 4. **Issue Detection**
```python
# User: "Any problems I should know about?"
check_customer_order_overdue(days_overdue=3)        # Delivery issues
check_production_order_overdue("ORDER%", days_overdue=1)  # Production delays
```

This reference ensures agents can translate any user request into the optimal tool combination for accurate, comprehensive results.
